# faker_experiment
This demonstrates creating simulated CareCloud.com patients using the Python faker package. See the documentation for their API at developer.carecloud.com. Notably, look at the /Appointments GET method.  Each Appointment object returned has a patient object. That is what the json here currently resembles.

Also, I am not a Python-savvy person, so I failed to do up a requirements.txt file, but will shortly. 

Finally, thanks to the makers of the Faker package, the people who share dideas on Stack Overflow, and ChatGPT for helping navigate all the important parts.
